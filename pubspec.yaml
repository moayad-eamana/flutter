  # The "flutter_lints" package below contains a set of recommended lints to

      fonts:

  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.
  uses-material-design: true


  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
  - assets/SVGs/background.svg 
  - assets/SVGs/splash.svg
  - assets/SVGs/brand-logo.svg
  - assets/SVGs/panel-bg.svg
  - assets/SVGs/header.png 
  - assets/SVGs/profileBackground.png 
  - assets/SVGs/amanah-v.png
  - assets/SVGs/etemadat.jpg
  - assets/SVGs/dumyprofile.png
  - assets/SVGs/asset4-100.jpg
  - assets/SVGs/appstore.png
  - assets/SVGs/Union_1.svg
  - assets/SVGs/Asset_1.svg
  - assets/image/gidam.png
  - assets/image/GiddamLogo.png
  - assets/image/
  - assets/SVGs/


  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  # fonts:
  #   - family: Schyler
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Regular.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
  #         style: italic
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
  #         weight: 700
  #
  # For details regarding fonts from package dependencies,
  # see https://flutter.dev/custom-fonts/#from-packages
